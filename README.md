## [Lilian Besson](https://perso.crans.org/besson/) [(@Naereen) on GitHub](https://naereen.github.io/)

[Hello there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yX-n57NRfc&hour=21) :wave: !
I am a :fr: French passionate coder on [GitHub](https://github.com/Naereen&day=mardi) (also [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/lbesson) & [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Naereen)!), and I love teaching!
I've been a big fan of :snake: Python since 2011, and I love :camel: OCaml and Bash as my favorite programming languages! Daily Bash user since 2011 too!

I am now a full-time professor of Computer Science in [Classes Préparatoires](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classes_pr%C3%A9paratoires_scientifiques) (in [MP2I](https://prepas.org/index.php?article=42)) from September 2021, in [Lycée Kléber](https://lycee-kleber.com.fr/) in [Strasbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg).
I teach computer science at baccalauréat +1 level, for one class of 48 students aged between 17 and 19 y-o, and I LOVE THIS JOB.

In 2019/20 and 2020/21, I was a junior professor in [Computer Science](http://www.dit.ens-rennes.fr/?maxAge=2592000) (and Mathematics) at [ENS de Rennes](http://www.ens-rennes.fr/) in France.

#### I enjoyed doing a PhD (2016-19)
Before that, [I pursued a Ph.D](https://perso.crans.org/besson/phd/) ([phd.pdf](https://perso.crans.org/besson/phd.pdf)) in telecommunications, applied mathematics, machine learning and computer science (yes, all that), at the engineering school CentraleSupélec in Rennes and at Inria in Lille since 2016 to 2019, and I graduated in November 2019. I [wrote research articles](https://perso.crans.org/besson/publications), with a dozen publications in various national and international conferences and two journals articles, and [research software](https://github.com/SMPyBandits/).
I continued doing some research after my PhD defense, but I had to stop completely in 2021.

#### I'm not only a (proud) geek!
Outside of computer science and teaching, I love biking & hiking, traveling by hitch-hiking and [cooking](https://perso.crans.org/besson/cuisine/) (I'm pro vegetarian!), fighting against the climate crisis and polluters, on a daily basis, on both personal associative and political levels, etc.
🏠 I live in Briançon during holidays and in Strasbourg otherwise.
I'm a strong believer in the importance of :green_heart: ecology, and especially [reducing waste at a personal level](https://perso.crans.org/besson/zero-dechet/) and [local](https://anv-cop21.org/) and [national political actions](https://www.eelv.fr/).
*Bien sûr*, I like video games, science fiction and fantasy! :rocket: I used to write a lot on [my blog](https://perso.crans.org/besson/index.en.html).

I'm a big fan of *Magic: the Gathering*, and long-time green/white Timmy player!
I'm now an official Magic judge (Level L1). Pauper, Modern or EDH, and sealed and cube (limited) are my favorite formats!
I play regularly at [this awesome place](https://www.aucoindujeu05.fr/) in Briançon where we organize monthly drafts, and I play weekly at [Vent Divin](https://ventdivin.com/) and [Baraka Jeux](https://barakajeuxstrasbourg.fr/) in Strasbourg!
(some of my deck lists are [here on GitHub](https://github.com/Naereen/My-Magic-the-Gathering-decks) or [here on Moxfield](https://www.moxfield.com/users/Naereen)).

#### More name dropping
💻 I work on Dell and HP laptops, using [XUbuntu 22.04+](https://xubuntu.org/), coding on [VSCode](https://perso.crans.org/besson/visualstudiocode.en.html), 🎵 listening to music with [gmusicbrowser](http://gmusicbrowser.org/) (and [this](https://github.com/Naereen/GMusicBrowser-FullScreen-WebApp)).
Since 2012, I write a lot of [tiny CLI scripts](https://github.com/Naereen/bin), and [build my website](https://github.com/Naereen/web-sphinx) using [sphinx](https://sphinx-doc.org/).
📝 I love mathematics, I teach a bit of maths on a weekly basis. I studied a lot of maths in my twenties, and I got the French national competitive exam for teaching ("agrégation") in 2014. Since then I've helped writing [a very good maths book for Agrégation and license/master level maths](https://laurent.claessens-donadello.eu/frido.html) (in 🇫🇷 French), and [this other one](https://www.dunod.com/prepas-concours/131-developpements-pourl-oral-agregation-externe-mathematiquesinformatique).
🤣 I'm a [big fan of memes](https://9gag.com), [various TV shows, movies and video-games](https://perso.crans.org/besson/top10.en.html).
