## [Lilian Besson](https://perso.crans.org/besson/) [(@Naereen) on GitHub](https://naereen.github.io/)

[Hello there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yX-n57NRfc) :wave: !
I am a :fr: French passionate coder on [GitHub](https://github.com/Naereen) (also [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/lbesson) & [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Naereen)!)
I used to define myself as a :snake: Python fan, nowadays I would most likely just say I like :snake: Python, :camel: OCaml and Bash as my favorite programming languages! I also love Julia, and would like to learn and use more Rust, GoLang and TypeScript.

Since September 2019, I am a junior professor in [Computer Science](http://www.dit.ens-rennes.fr/) (and Mathematics) at [ENS de Rennes](http://www.ens-rennes.fr/) in France, and I love teaching!
<details style="margin-left:3%;">
<summary>More details on my teaching</summary>
<p>I teach various courses: a long course <a href="https://perso.crans.org/besson/teach/INF1_L1_Rennes1_2020-21/">INF1</a> at L1 (+1) level at University Rennes 1 (introduction to programming in Java), a short one <a href="https://perso.crans.org/besson/teach/intro_num_DEM_2020/">"Introduction to Computer Science"</a> at L3 (+3) level for law and economics students at ENS Rennes. Most of my hours are for computer science students at ENS Rennes: classes or practical sessions for <a href="https://perso.crans.org/besson/teach/info1_algo1_2019/">Algorithms 1/2</a>, I grade projects for a <a href="https://mquinson.frama.io/prog2-cpp/">advanced programming course in C++</a> at L3 (+3) level ; I also give practical sessions for <a href="https://perso.crans.org/besson/teach/Traitement_de_Signal_2020/">Signal Processing</a> at M1 (+4) level. I also <a href="http://www.dit.ens-rennes.fr/seminaires/">invite researchers to come talk to our students</a> twice a month, reach me out if you're interested! My main task is to manage the <a href="http://www.dit.ens-rennes.fr/agregation-option-d/">intense training for national competitive exam "agrégation de mathématiques"</a> for the Computer Science minor, for which I teach various small courses at M2 (+5) level, and give rehearsal oral exams (see <a href="https://perso.crans.org/besson/notebooks/agreg/">notebooks</a>).</p>

#### I enjoyed doing a PhD (2016-19)
Before that, [I pursued a Ph.D](https://perso.crans.org/besson/phd/) ([phd.pdf](https://perso.crans.org/besson/phd.pdf)) in telecommunications, applied mathematics, machine learning and computer science, at the engineering school CentraleSupélec in Rennes and at Inria in Lille since 2016 to 2019, and I graduated in November 2019. I [wrote research articles](https://perso.crans.org/besson/publications) and [research software](https://github.com/SMPyBandits/). I do less research but still a little bit, since my PhD defense.

#### I'm not only a (proud) geek!
Outside of computer science and teaching, I love biking, hiking, traveling by hitch-hiking, [cooking](https://perso.crans.org/besson/cuisine/) etc.
:bed: I live alone and work at home in Rennes, and I'm a strong believer in the importance of :green_heart: ecology, and especially [reducing waste at a personal level](https://perso.crans.org/besson/zero-dechet/) and [local and national political actions](https://anv-cop21.org/).
I'm passionate about video games, science fiction, and fantasy! :rocket: I write a lot on [my blog](https://perso.crans.org/besson/index.en.html).

#### More name dropping
:computer: I work on Dell and HP laptops, using [XUbuntu 18.04+](https://xubuntu.org/), [VSCode](https://perso.crans.org/besson/visualstudiocode.en.html), :musical_note: listening to music with [gmusicbrowser](http://gmusicbrowser.org/) (and [this](https://github.com/Naereen/GMusicBrowser-FullScreen-WebApp)).
Since 2012, I write a lot of [tiny CLI scripts](https://github.com/Naereen/bin), [build my website](https://github.com/Naereen/web-sphinx) using [sphinx](https://sphinx-doc.org/).
:pencil: I love mathematics, got "agrégation" in 2014, and since then I've helped writing the [best maths book ever](https://laurent.claessens-donadello.eu/frido.html) (in :fr: French), and [this other one](https://www.dunod.com/prepas-concours/131-developpements-pourl-oral-agregation-externe-mathematiquesinformatique).
:rofl: I'm a [big fan of memes](https://9gag.com), [various TV shows, movies and video-games](https://perso.crans.org/besson/top10.en.html).
